# Horisen Code Refactor

## Description

The code has been refactored for improved accessibility, without editing the appearance of the website.

### Code refactoring:
* Added Horiseon title to website
* Added semantic HTML elements
* Corrected navigation linking
* Added alt text to images
* Added explanatory comments to HTML and CSS documents
* Consolidated CSS classes and ids with matching properties
* Reorganised CSS to follow HTML semantic and logical structure
* Updated copyright year in footer

## Usage

This application presents the website homepage for Horiseon, a marketing agency. It can be viewed in any desktop browser. 
**Note**: The application is currently non-responsive and therefore is not optimised for screens with a resolution smaller than 768px.
